**How to Use?**

To enable the video features, add a video from the post editor or use the HTML video tag. You can include as many video tags as needed.

**Creating Video Playlists**

You can create a video playlist within your editor by using the block. 

Or by using the advanced settings panel and setting it to "bvideo_playlist." Alternatively, you can create a list in your HTML with the id "bvideo_playlist."

Here's an example HTML playlist:

```html
<ol id="bvideo_playlist">
    <li><a href="video1.mp4">Video 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="video2.mp4">Video 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="video3.mp4">Video 3</a></li>
</ol>
```

You can also create a playlist using a JavaScript array:

```javascript
<script>
var video_playlist = [
    {
        "name": "Video 1",
        "link": "video1.mp4",
        "size": 55000000
    },
    {
        "name": "Video 2",
        "link": "video2.mp4",
        "size": 475000000
    },
    {
        "name": "Video 3",
        "link": "video3.mp4",
        "size": 105000000
    }
];
</script>
```
